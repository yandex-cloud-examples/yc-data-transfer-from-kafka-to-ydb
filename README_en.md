# Delivering data from a Yandex Managed Service for Apache Kafka® queue to Yandex Managed Service for YDB through Yandex Data Transfer

With [Data Transfer](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-transfer), you can deliver data from a [Managed Service for Apache Kafka®](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/managed-kafka) cluster to a [Managed Service for YDB](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/ydb) database in real time. See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-transfer/tutorials/mkf-to-ydb) to learn how to set up the solution with Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [data-transfer-mkf-ydb.tf](data-transfer-mkf-ydb.tf).
